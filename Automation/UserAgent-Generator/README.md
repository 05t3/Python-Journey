# Random User Agent Generator

This is a simple Python script that generates random User Agents. User Agents are commonly used in web scraping, automation, and testing applications to mimic different browsers and devices.

# Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required fake_useragent library by running `pip install fake_useragent`.
3. Download the `random_useragent.py` script from this repository.
4. Run the script using the command `python random_useragent.py`.
5. The script will generate a random User Agent and display it in the console.


# Customization
By default, i have set the default UserAgents to be generated as 500. You can tweak the script to print as many variations as possible.
