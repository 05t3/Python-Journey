# My Python Journey

Hey there and welcome tomy python Journey.
Special thanks to [@Parsz](https://github.com/P4rsz), [@PentesterG](https://twitter.com/PentesterG) for the encouragement and motivation to get started.

# Notes

- Variable basically holds a value.

## Naming rules

- Variables can only contain `letters`, `numbers`, and `underscores`. Variable names can start with a letter or an underscore, but can not start with a number.
- Spaces are not allowed in variable names, so we use underscores instead of spaces. For example, use `student_name` instead of "student name".
- Variable names should be descriptive, without being too long. For example mc_wheels is better than just "wheels", and number_of_wheels_on_a_motorycle.
- Be careful about using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O in places where they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.
- You cannot use Python [keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#:~:text=2.3.1.-,Keywords,-%C2%B6) as variable names, i.e

# Comments

In Python, any line that starts with a pound (#) symbol is ignored by the Python interpreter.

i.e

```python
# This line is a comment
print("Hey there!")
```

### What makes a good comment?

- It is short and to the point, but a complete thought. Most comments should be written in complete sentences.
- It explains your thinking, so that when you return to the code later you will understand how you were approaching the problem.
- It explains your thinking, so that others who work with your code will understand your overall approach to a problem.
- It explains particularly difficult sections of code in detail.

### When should you write comments?

- When you have to think about code before writing it.
- When you are likely to forget later exactly how you were approaching a problem.
- When there is more than one way to solve a problem.
- When others are unlikely to anticipate your way of thinking about a problem.

Writing good comments is one of the clear signs of a good programmer. If you have any real interest in taking programming seriously, start using comments now. You will see them throughout the examples in these notebooks.
